Docco is a documentation generator that can run on litcoffee files

The idea is you write a lit coffee file and it automatically is parsed into a HTML viewable document.

it can also run as a coffee script file

JUSTIFY THE NEED FOR A GENERATOR for CODECONV !

docco works because you have to write the code anyway, and you're commenting about the code

you're writing code in every project

CODE CONV is not written for every project, or maybe it is...

you have a CODE CONV for everyproject and it sits in your repo.

.codeconv

it generates a well documentated html page

why do you need a generator ? 

and not just a really good template people can copy and paste ?

Q: Does this need to be done more than once ?

A: once per project ?

but people dont want to write the resulting HTML as it s fucking ugly.
so give them a way to write markdown, run your codeconv generator which is simply a template engine

Generate the documentation for our configured source file by copying over static
assets, reading all the source files in, splitting them up into prose+code
sections, highlighting each file in the appropriate language, and printing them
out in an HTML template.
